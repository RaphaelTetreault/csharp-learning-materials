# Other Number Formats

Not all number formats are listed. This is because some are particularly niche and unimportant to a beginner. The excluded formats are found below.

* "G" or "g" - general: a compact format specifying either fixed-point or exponential.
* "R" or "r" - round-trip: a format made for round-tripping numbers in a text-serialized format.
