# Other Unary Operators

Unary operators act on a single value. In this folder, some unary operators are not present since they overlap with other categories.

Unary `+`, `-`, `++`, and `--` operators are placed here and are common in general programming.

The logical negation operator `!` is found in the `../logical-operators` folder.

The bitwise compliment (not) `~` is found in the `../binary-operators` folder.
