```csharp
        // The \" is called an escape sequence. Recall that we define a string
        // inside two quotation marks. However, what if we want to print a
        // quotation mark inside a string? We need a way to tell C# to print
        // the character instead of interpreting it as part of our code. The
        // backslash character '\' begins the escape sequence, telling C#
        // to treat the next character " differently; \" prints ".
