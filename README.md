# C# Learning Materials
A selection of C# example programs to teach undergraduate game design students game programming.

## Intent

The repository is meant to house a number of C# examples which explore foundational programming concepts. Exercises herein are meant to challenge students on these concepts. Moreover, these resources represent about 5 weeks of a larger courses. Latter portions of the same course focus more on game development programming exercises and look at 2D game development frameworks. Such exercises can be found in another repo (to be created at the time of writing).
