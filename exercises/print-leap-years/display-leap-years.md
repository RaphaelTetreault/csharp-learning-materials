# Display Leap Years

This exercise is adapted from the exercise presented here: https://adriann.github.io/programming_problems.html (Elementary, #10).

The exercise asks students to print a certain amount of leap years to the console. Versions of the question asked include:

* Print the next 20 years
  * Requires defining the starting year, counting number of leap years, then breaking the loop.
* Print all leap years between [start year] and [end year].
  * Requires iterating through years in this range (for or while loop), and printing the appropriate years. I think this question provide more flexibility to students.

## Resources

* [Leap year, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year), general information bout leap year.
* [Leap Years- we can do better, YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkt_wmRKYNQ&ab_channel=Stand-upMaths) - goes through all of the western Leap Year conditions.
